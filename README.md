### Pricing Component Challenge

This repository contains my solution to the Pricing Component Challenge. The challenge was to build a pricing component using React.js that closely matches the provided design. The component should be interactive, responsive to various screen sizes, and accessible for all users.

### Features

My implementation of the pricing component includes the following features:

- Toggle Control: Users can easily control the toggle switch using both their mouse/trackpad and keyboard.

- Responsive Design: The component's layout adjusts optimally depending on the user's device screen size. It is visually appealing and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.

- Interactive Elements: I have implemented hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page to enhance the user experience.

### Technologies Used

I used the following technologies and tools to complete this challenge:

- React.js
